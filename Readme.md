# Documentation Coverage Plugin

Node Version required: 14 or above

## Install

```

  1. npm i doc-coverage
  2. Create a .doccoverage.json file in the root of the project.
  3. For help on the config file created in step 5, refer 'Config Help' section
  4. Run the command "./node_modules/.bin/doc" in the terminal in root directory to get coverage.
  5. A folder called doc-coverage is created in the root. It contains a detailed coverage report.

```

## Config Help

```

Config refers to the json that need to be added in .doccoverage.json file. Following are the available keys with description.

  1. source - Path to the source folder.
  2. excludedPaths - Array of Path regex to be ignored while calculating Coverage of the pure JS Files.
  3. excludedComponentPaths - Array of Path regex to be ignored while calculating Component File Coverage(inside components folder).
   * Example - if only index files are to be considered for stories, add "^((?!index.js).)*$" in the array. This ignores all files except index.
  4. foldersWithComponentFiles - Array of folder names containing all UI components.
  5. storiesFolderPath - Path to the stories folder to be provided if it is outside the source folder.
  6. ecmaVersion - ECMA Script Version (required for parsing into ast), by default latest is used.
  7. framework - framework used (currently react, vue and svelte are supported), by default react.

```

## Ignore a Component File

```
  If a particular Component file is to be ignored and a genric path regex to exclude cannot be created -
  Add '/* !Doc Coverage Ignore */' as the first line in the file.

  Example of a situation when one might need to ignore a file -
  A small Component file with no props, for which niether storybook nor proptype is required.

```

## Sample Config

```javascript
{
	"source": "./src",
	"excludedPaths": ["/assets/", "/components/","/containers/", "/__test__/", "/config./"],
	"excludedComponentPaths": ["/__test__/", "^((?!index.js).)*$"],
	"foldersWithComponentFiles": ["components", "containers"],
  	"framework": "svelte",
	"storiesFolderPath": "./stories"
}

```

## Default Config

```
If no config is provided, the following is used as the default config

{
        source: './src',
        excludedPaths: [
          '/assets/',
          '/components/',
          '/containers/',
          '/__test__/',
          '/config./',
          '__snapshots__',
        ],
        excludedComponentPaths: ['/__test__/'],
        foldersWithComponentFiles: ['components', 'containers'],
        storiesFolderPath: './stories',
 }

```

## Results Summary in console

```

Refer the following image link for example.

   We get 3 tables in the console -

   1. JS Files Coverage - For Non Component files. The script looks for leading documentation comments for all top level blocks of a file.
      ( 1 scope = 1 top level block/function )

   2. Component File Coverage - A Component File is considered fully documented if it is either imported in atleast one '.stories' file or has prop types defined.
      We get 3 scores in this table -
      	1. Fully Covered Components - Fully documented Components / Total Components
        2. Storybook Coverage - Components with stories / Total Components
	      3. PropTypes Coverage - Num of prop types / Total Props

3.  Total Coverage - Combined Score of JS Files and each of the three Component Scores.

```

## Detailed Coverage Report

```
 A file called docCoverageReport.json is created under a directory called doc-coverage which contains the file wise coverage.

 Apart from giving the same information as the tables in console it has 2 extra keys -
 1. fileWiseCoverageJSFiles - Object with file path as the key.
    Example:
    "path-to-app/src/app.js": {
            "funcCoverage": {
                "urlB64ToUint8Array": false,
                "onMessageReceivedSubscriptionState": true,
                "onMessageReceivedSubscribe": true,
                "onMessageReceivedUnsubscribe": true,
                "broadcastReply": true,
                "persistSubscriptionLocally": true
            },
            "fileCoverage": "83.33%"
        },

 2. fileWiseCoverageJSX/fileWiseCoverageVue/fileWiseCoverageSvelte - Object with file path as the key.
    Example:
    "path-to-app/src/index.js": {
            "hasStory": false,
            "hasAllPropTypes": false,
            "componentType": "Functional",
            "missingPropTypes": [
                "error",
                "timedOut",
                "pastDelay"
            ],
            "coverage": "25%"
    }


```

## Important Note

```
To get an accurate proptypes coverage, destructure the props.
Currently this syntax is not identified by the parser => {props.something}.
Instead use the following syntax
const {x,y,z} = props;


```
